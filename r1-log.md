# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Marvourneen Dolor

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on August 13, Monday, 2018.

## Log
_I only joined the challenge via cloning this repo after I completed my first #100DaysofCode, so providing a summary here_.

### R1D1 - R1D70
- Worked my way through related freeCodeCamp challenges and earned the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/marvokdolor/responsive-web-design) Certificate.

### R1D71 - R1D100
- Worked my way through Basic JavaScript, ES6, Regular Expressions, Debugging, Basic Data Structures, Basic Algorith Scripting, Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and some Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges - all part of [fCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/).
- Posted [weekly](https://mkdolor.tumblr.com/post/180272303751/learning-to-code-weekly-update-11192018) [blog](https://mkdolor.tumblr.com/post/180067995791/learning-to-code-weekly-update-11122018) [posts](https://mkdolor.tumblr.com/post/179787078382/learning-to-code-weekly-update-1152018) about my Learning to Code experience and figured out a way to [write and test JavaScript code](https://mkdolor.tumblr.com/post/180409330404/testing-javascript-code) outside of fCC's interface, which was subpar for this use case.

I've started a log for my second consecutive #100DaysofCode challenge [here](r2-log.md).
